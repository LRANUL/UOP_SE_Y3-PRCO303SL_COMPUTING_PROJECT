##	Module Details
###	Module Aims 
To enable the student to undertake a individual project on an approved topic of interest, that addresses a significant computing related problem relevant to the programme of study. To provide an opportunity for the student to integrate many of the threads of their programme of study.
###	Assessed Learning Outcomes
At the end of the module the learner will be expected to be able to:
1.	Demonstrate an investigative component to the project showing consolidation and development of knowledge and understanding relevant to their programme of study.
2.	Produce an approved deliverable appropriate to the programme of study that addresses a significant computing related problem. This will include a substantial design/problem-solving content, use of appropriate methodology, clear analytical techniques and the synthesis and validation of solutions.
3.	Manage a project effectively by demonstrating the application of project management skills such as planning, time management, problem solving, and management of learning.
Communicate effectively all aspects of the project deliverables including the theoretical and methodological framework.  Explain where appropriate the processes of analysis, design, and production and testing etc. Demonstrate and explain the project deliverables. Critically evaluate the solution and the process by which the solution has been achieved. Provide a critical self-evaluation of the management of the project.

## Module Assessment
Your performance in a module will be assessed during the academic year, normally through a combination of coursework and end of year examinations. You must pass the assessments in order to be credited with that module for your award. In addition, some modules may have to be passed as pre-requisites for others taken later in your programme. 

The method of assessment varies between modules and your lecturers will advise you of the method(s) to be used. This reflects the need to develop a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as different skills.

PRCO303SL - Computing Project is assessed in the following way:
| Coursework | 100 |
| --------------- | --------------- |

In all cases these assessment methods have been chosen and designed to assess your achievement of the particular learning outcomes for the module. You will be given Assessment Criteria, which is used to judge the extent of your achievement. 

## Assessment Criteria

All submissions and the viva voce must be completed. There is a full criteria document supplied as part of the module documentation.  To pass the student will have achieved basic project aims, having some effective product deliverable, showing some amount of critical awareness, with a report and viva which demonstrates a basic level of understanding of process, methodology, review and evaluation.

You are requested to adhere to the assessment guidelines given by the relevant lecturer for each module.
| Stages | Criteria | Marks |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Product (60 Marks) | Successful conclusion of the project | 12 |
| | Meeting the proposed project aims | 12 |

##### Assessment mode

100% coursework: comprising required Interim Submissions, Final Report, and compulsory Viva Voce examination.  

The Interim Submissions include Initial Proposal, Project Initiation Document, 1st and 2nd Interim Progress Report and Poster for the Project Fair.  

Project management is an important aspect of the assessment – including planning, time management, problem solving, and management of learning making appropriate use of supervision and showing involvement at the Project Fair.

## Submission of Assessed Work

Each individual student will receive an aural feedback as well as a written document based on their performance.

Module Leaders publish deadlines for the submission of all assessed work. You should read this Module Handbook carefully to ensure that you are aware of all the deadlines that apply to you. 
Please also see the Assessment Flowchart within your student handbook. 


### Extenuating Circumstances
Extenuating Circumstances are circumstances which:

•	Affect your ability to attend or complete an assessment or a number of assessments 
•	Are exceptional 
•	Are outside your control 
•	Can be corroborated by independent evidence 
•	Occurred during or shortly before the assessment in question 

Students who wish to claim Extenuating Circumstances should obtain a claim form from their HE Office. The form should be submitted to the HE Office accompanied by independent supporting evidence. 

Assessed coursework / major project / dissertation or equivalent:
Extenuating Circumstances claims should be submitted as soon as possible, and normally no later than 10 working days after the deadline for the submission of the work. 

Formal Examinations:
Extenuating Circumstances claims with respect to formal examinations should be submitted no later than the Monday after the end of the formal examination week.

For further information about Extenuating circumstances please see your Institution Handbook. 

## Assessment Feedback
Feedback is an important element of your learning on this module. 

Coursework feedback will be issued to students within 20 working days. Please note that all marks are provisional until they are confirmed at the Award Board.
