Background of Ministry of Education\n    Since independence, the government has given the highest priority to education. Within a period of less than 60\n      years, the number of schools increased by over 50%, the number of students increased by more than 300%, and the\n      number of teachers increased by more than 400%. The literacy rate has grown correspondingly and by mid-1980s, over\n      90% of the population was literate.\n\n      The difficulties of educational planning in the past caused by the system of dual control and lack of coordination\n      were finally removed by the nationalization of schools in 1960. The National Education Commission (NEC), in 1961,\n      recommended a system of school zones, and the establishment of regional education departments and district\n      education offices.\n\n      In 1970, there were 2.7 million students in 9928 government schools. Due to the increasing demand, government of\n      Sri Lanka (GoSL) faced the problem of improving the quality of education and the mismatch between education and\n      the labor market. Therefore, GoSL implemented a range of reforms in 1972, and the 1981 White Paper on education\n      recommended a new subject (life skills) in place of the two pre-vocational subjects; a dual system of evaluation;\n      and a school cluster system.

Within a period of less than 60      years, the number of schools increased by over 50%, the number of students increased by more than 300%, and the      number of teachers increased by more than 400%. The literacy rate has grown correspondingly and by mid-1980s, over      90% of the population was literate.      The difficulties of educational planning in the past caused by the system of dual control and lack of coordination      were finally removed by the nationalization of schools in 1960. The National Education Commission (NEC), in 1961,      recommended a system of school zones, and the establishment of regional education departments and district      education offices.      In 1970, there were 2.7 million students in 9928 government schools. Due to the increasing demand, government of      Sri Lanka (GoSL) faced the problem of improving the quality of education and the mismatch between education and      the labor market. Therefore, GoSL implemented a range of reforms in 1972, and the 1981 White Paper on education      recommended a new subject (life skills) in place of the two pre-vocational subjects; a dual system of evaluation;      and a school cluster system.

Sri Lanka\n    The Foreign Ministry coordinates and carries out the foreign policy of the Government of Sri Lanka. The Ministry\n      of\n      Foreign Relations consists of the Ministry headquarters in Colombo and the missions abroad.\n    \n    \n      The Ministry was formally established in 1948 following the independence of Ceylon as the Ministry of External\n      Affairs and Defence, coming under the direct control of the Prime Minister of Ceylon. In 1977, the government\n      divided the ministry in two, forming the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A.C.S Hameed was\n      appointed as the first Minister of Foreign Affairs on 4 February 1978.\n    \n    The Economic Affairs Division is mainly facilitating Promotional Activities in Selected Markets under the\n      Economic\n      Diplomacy Programme, with the active participation of Sri Lanka Missions and the Government economic agencies.As\n      each market has a different set of strengths; this sub-programme is designed to identify the key markets and\n      propose\n      suitable promotional strategies catered to those strengths.
