independence, the government has given the highest priority to education. Within a period of less than 60\n      years, the number of schools increased by over 50%, the number of students increased by more than 300%, and the\n      number of teachers increased by more than 400%. The literacy rate has grown correspondingly and by mid-1980s, over\n      90% of the population was literate.\n\n      The difficulties of educational planning in the past caused by the system of dual control and lack of coordination\n      were finally removed by the nationalization of schools in 1960. The National Education Commission (NEC), in 1961,\n      recommended a system of school zones, and the establishment of regional education departments and district\n      education offices.\n\n      In 1970, there were 2.7 million students in 9928 government schools. Due to the increasing demand, government of\n      Sri Lanka (GoSL) faced the problem of improving the quality of education and the mismatch between education and\n      the labor market. Therefore, GoSL implemented a range of reforms in 1972, and the 1981 White Paper on education\n      recommended a new subject (life skills) in place of the two pre-vocational subjects; a dual system of evaluation;\n      and a school cluster system. The 1997 education reforms covered major policy areas such as extending educational\n      opportunities; improving the quality of education; developing practical and technical skills; education and\n      training of teachers; and management and resource provision.\n    Functions\n    \n      Training Certificates\n      School Affairs\n      Education, Training, Research and Development\n      Vocational Training\n      Higher Education\n    \n    Vision\n    “To reach excellence in global society through competent citizens who share the Sri Lankan identity”\n    Mission\n    “Develop competent citizens keeping with the global trends through innovative and modern approaches to education\n      leading to efficiency, equity and high quality performance ensuring stakeholder satisfaction”\n    \n      Apply for your Educational services through Government Portal\n    \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Government Portal\n        Ministry of Home Affairs\n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./education.page.scss\n                \n                #container {\n    text-align: center;\n  \n    position: absolute;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translateY(-50%);\n  }\n  \n  #container strong {\n    font-size: 20px;\n    line-height: 26px;\n  }\n  \n  #container p {\n    font-size: 16px;\n    line-height: 22px;\n  \n    color: #8c8c8c;\n  \n    margin: 0;\n  }\n  \n  #container a {\n    text-decoration: none;\n  }\n  \n  .underline {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: blue;\n    font-size: large;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  .underline-search {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: #0000ff;\n    font-size: medium;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '                                            GOVERNMENT PORTAL                                            WELCOME TO GOVERNMENT PORTAL    All government services at one place.                      {{ algoliaResult.name }}                                    Education        Background of Ministry of Education    Since independence, the government has given the highest priority to education.
